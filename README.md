and how G2 Esports, the winners of Lec 2022 Spring, were able to win through better understanding of meta knowledge dispite having a new roster
(Broken Blade (top), Jankos (jungle), Caps (mid), Flakked (adc), and Targamas (support).
around new and unproven players in comparison to their (2018-2021) roster that made ether World Finals, World Semis, or never made worlds (2021).
